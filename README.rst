Disclaimer
==========

As I couldn't find any real documentation for writing gnome-shell extensions, I based my code on better or worse snippets and tutorials found on internet. Some of the sources are mentioned below:

* `Musings of an OS plumber <http://blog.fpmurphy.com/tag/gnome-shell>`_
* `gnome-shell-extensions <http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-shell-extensions/>`_


Instalation
===========

  
The NoUserStatus@zdyb.tk directory should be copied to /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions or ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/::

  # cp NoUserStatus\@zdyb.tk /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions
  
or::

  $ cp NoUserStatus\@zdyb.tk ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
